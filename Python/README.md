2. the board get two number when game initial
3. use `w s a d` to move, equals `up down left right`
4. when move effective, the board will random generate a new number that maybe `2` or `4`
5. when move fail, the board will unchanged and not number will generate
6. `2` and `4` generate ratio is `8:2`
7. if the number can't move, the game will end
